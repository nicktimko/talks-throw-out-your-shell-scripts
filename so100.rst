1-10
======

1. +4324 `Get the source directory of a Bash script from within the script itself`_

    ``__file__`` is the file itself, so to get the parent:

    .. code-block:: python

        # fully resolved
        pathlib.Path(__file__).parent
        os.path.abspath(os.path.join(__file__, os.path.pardir))

        # may still be relative
        pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
        os.path.normpath(os.path.join(__file__, os.path.pardir))

2. +2875 `How do I tell if a regular file does not exist in Bash?`_

    Use :py:func:`os.path.exists` or :py:meth:`pathlib.Path.exists`, or just ``try`` it as it's EAFP than to LBYL.

3. +2390 `How to concatenate string variables in Bash`_

    Yes, this is not obvious in Bash. ``string1 + string2``.

4. +2027 `How to check if a string contains a substring in Bash`_

    Also tricky...in Bash. Trivial in Python: ``substring in string``.

5. +1938 `In the shell, what does " 2>&1 " mean?`_

    The syntax generally isn't as obscure, and to do something like switching stdout and stderr, you don't need to master crazy heiroglyphics like ``3>&1- 1>&2- 2>&3-``.

6. +1902 `Echo newline in Bash prints literal \\n`_

    Escaping feels inconsistent in Bash, versus in Python where there is a clear distinction between :py:func:`repr`\ sentations of strings and presentation of them via :py:func:`print()`.

7. +1819 `How to check if a program exists from a Bash script?`_

    Try it, or :py:func:`shutil.which`.

8. +1801 `Extract filename and extension in Bash`_

    :py:func:`os.path.splitext`, :py:attr:`pathlib.PurePath.name`, :py:attr:`pathlib.PurePath.suffix`

9. +1692 `How do I split a string on a delimiter in Bash?`_

    :py:meth:`str.split`

10. +1561 `How do I parse command line arguments in Bash?`_

    :py:mod:`argparse` or DIY from :py:data:`sys.argv`.


11-20
======

11. +1414 `How to count all the lines of code in a directory recursively?`_

12. +1370 `How to change the output color of echo in Linux`_

    Here it's more about interacting with the terminal emulator, so you basically can do the same thing as Bash does. However, the escapes can be tricky a la the "how do I echo a newline" question above, while in Python it's much more clear. At the most basic::

        print("\x1B[91mTHIS IS RED\x1B[0m")

    There are also cross-platform terminal color libraries like ``colorama`` which can make life easier too.

13. +1364 `How do I reload .bashrc without logging out and back in?`_


14. +1336 `How can I redirect and append both stdout and stderr to a file with Bash?`_

    When running a subprocess, you can combine the streams if you specify ``stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``.

15. +1295 `How to set a variable to the output of a command in Bash?`_
     ``[command-line]`` ``[shell]``

    Yes, this is *also* non-obvious in Bash.

16. +1245 `How do I prompt for Yes/No/Cancel input in a Linux shell script?`_

    Read via :py:func:`input` and do whatever you want.

17. +1242 `How to check if a variable is set in Bash?`_

    Bash doesn't

18. +1235 `How do I iterate over a range of numbers defined by variables in Bash?`_

    ``for n in range(x, y, z):``

19. +1202 `Loop through an array of strings in Bash?`_

    ``for s in strings:``

20. +1097 `Looping through the content of a file in Bash`_

    ``for line in open_file:``

21-30
======

21. +1061 `Check existence of input argument in a Bash shell script`_

    argparse.

22. +1048 `Difference between sh and bash`_

    *Vaguely* similar to Python 2/3; sometimes you can pretend they're the same, but you need to know the difference when it matters.

23. +1030 `How to convert a string to lower case in Bash?`_

    :py:meth:`str.lower`

24. +1020 `Make a Bash alias that takes a parameter?`_

    A Bash alias is a canned command, you'd need to do this with a function.

25. +937 `YYYY-MM-DD format date in shell script`_

    The ``strftime`` specifications are the same as they're from C, and in Python you use them with :py:meth:`datetime.datetime.strftime`.

26. +920 `What is the preferred Bash shebang?`_

    A good question for Python as well, there's ``#!/usr/bin/env python``, or ...``python3``...

27. +902 `echo that outputs to stderr`_

    ::

        import sys

        print(..., file=sys.stderr)

28. +879 `How to count lines in a document?`_

    There are a few methods involving iterating over an open file and incrementing, and you can look at `other Stack Overflow questions <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9629179/python-counting-lines-in-a-huge-10gb-file-as-fast-as-possible>`_ for more discussion. Notably, if this *is* a bottleneck, you can easily call out to ``wc``.

29. +851 `How to pipe stderr, and not stdout?`_



30. +845 `How to specify the private SSH-key to use when executing shell command on Git?`_
     ``[git]`` ``[shell]`` ``[ssh]``

======

41. +759 `How to trim whitespace from a Bash variable?`_

    :py:meth:`str.strip`

42. +755 `How to declare and use boolean variables in shell script?`_

    This is non-obvious because there isn't a boolean type in shell. There are also myriad ways to get it wrong that "look" nice if you view the question.

43. +749 `How can I exclude all "permission denied" messages from "find"?`_
    ``[error-handling]`` ``[file-permissions]`` ``[find]``

44. +724 `How to permanently set $PATH on Linux/Unix?`_
    ``[linux]`` ``[path]`` ``[unix]`` ``[zsh]``

45. +705 `What are the special dollar sign shell variables?`_

    Python has a cleaner return semantics from calls, so it doesn't need magic variables like ``$?``. That said, Python has ``_`` which can be useful in *interactive* contexts.

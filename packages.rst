Packages
================

You can accomplish a lot with standard Python, and in the context where I'm advocating for its use here, i.e. instead of Bash, I'm largely trying to illustrate how much you can do without any dependencies when it's just there to be used on many distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS...sorta).

However, there are packages that can supercharge the powers so you can do much, much more. Here are a few I've used in the past.


Argument Parsing: Click

Argument Parsing: docopt
